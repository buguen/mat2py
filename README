Matlab to Numpy 
---------------

mat2py is a simple bash script intended to help the conversion of an 

existing matlab file (.m) into a python file exploiting the suite (numpy + scipy + matplotlib)  

Warning : the result is not directly usable but reduces a bit the editing work 

new rules based on sed regular expression can be added in the mat2py file 


assuming myprog.m exists 

	$ mat2py myprog  

will produce a file myprog.py with various matlab syntax element substituted with their python equivalent 


	mat2py exploit the bash command : rule 

The python packages used are : 

	import numpy as np 	
	import scipy as sp 
        import scipy.linalg as la 
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

You are welcome to commit any new rule you are judging interesting to add
